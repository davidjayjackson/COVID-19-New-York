## Benford's Law Analysis for New Yoirk and Selected US States (Cases and Deaths)
### Is New York State "Cooking their Books" for Covid19 Deaths?
#### Comparing New  York State to:
* Texas,Florida,Illinois,Pennsylvania,Ohio,California,Georgia
  

#### New York Times (Jan. 28, 2020)

* N.Y. Severely Undercounted Virus Deaths in Nursing Homes
"The state attorney general, Letitia James, said itâ€™s likely that the Cuomo administration failed to report thousands of Covid-19 deaths of nursing home residents."

#### New York Times COVID-19 Github Repository

* NEW-YORK-DEATHS-METHODOLOGY.md
"Starting with data for Aug. 6, we are switching to reporting deaths in New York State by county of residence instead of the county in which the death took place."

### Introduction:
* If based on the two quotes from the New York Times that New York State is intentionally understating the deaths in Nursing Homes.
* Analysis will be done using Benford's Law first (1st) digit distribution.
* The conclusion,  Any state  that's first digit analysis (Covid-19 Deaths) is simalar to New York State deaths is probably also "fiddling" with their deaths counts.
